## gradient_descent
### Implementing the Gradient Descent Algorithm
In this lab, we'll implement the basic functions of the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the boundary in a small dataset. 

## student_admission
### Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks
In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
GRE Scores (Test)
GPA Scores (Grades)
Class rank (1-4)
The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
