## common_book_optimization
### Optimizing Code: Common Books
In this exercise, we'll use vector operations and data structure to optimize finding common books in two lists.

## gradient_descent
### Implementing the Gradient Descent Algorithm
In this lab, we'll implement the basic functions of the Gradient Descent algorithm to find the boundary in a small dataset. 

## holiday_gift_optimization
### Optimizing Code: Holiday Gifts
In this exercise, we'll use vector operations to optimize calculating costs of holiday gifts.

## refactor_wine_quality
### Refactor: Wine Quality Analysis
In this exercise, you'll refactor code that analyzes a wine quality dataset taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository here. Each row contains data on a wine sample, including several physicochemical properties gathered from tests, as well as a quality rating evaluated by wine experts.

## Sentiment_Classification
### Sentiment Classification & How To "Frame Problems" for a Neural Network
In this mini project, We'll make sentiment classification using neural network. Noise reduction and efficiency improvement is applied to the preprocessing process.

## student_admission
## student_admission_keras
### Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks
In this notebook, we predict student admissions to graduate school at UCLA based on three pieces of data:
GRE Scores (Test)
GPA Scores (Grades)
Class rank (1-4)
The dataset originally came from here: http://www.ats.ucla.edu/
One writes the neural network framework using Python and the other uses Keras.
